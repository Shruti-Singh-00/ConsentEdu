            <p class="txt block">I graduated from Harvard Business School in May 2024 and moved to San Francisco to focus full-time on building Consent Ed. Prior to my MBA, I worked as an investment banker specializing in EdTech and later took on an operator role at Vedantu, a Series E EdTech startup. After that, I became an EdTech investor at GSV Ventures, where I gained valuable insights into scaling impactful education solutions.

            <p class="txt block">As a first-generation college graduate, I’ve experienced firsthand how education can be a powerful enabler of systemic change. Growing up in India and later moving to the US, I saw how topics like consent, boundaries, and respectful interactions were often overlooked in traditional education. This gap has led to widespread misunderstandings and unhealthy dynamics in many social contexts. I founded Consent Ed to address this gap and create a platform that equips individuals with the skills to navigate complex social situations confidently and respectfully.
